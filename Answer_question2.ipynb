Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge. Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission. During gameplay, characters will call out if something happens to them, such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks. Each character has specific \" Potentials \", skills unique to each character. They are divided into \" Personal Potential \", which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character, and \" Battle Potentials \", which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character. To learn Battle Potentials, each character has a unique \" Masters Table \", a grid @ - @ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills. Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge, the character Reila can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible, while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon.'},\n",
